## _SeaChange 360_ README

SeaChange 360, Created by Debrah Pearson Feinn and Jerry Fried, is an immersive multimedia installation that explores humanity's connection to the ocean through evocative video and immersive audio.  The system involves a stretched circular curtain that rings a 20 - 30 foot area, upon which is projected the 20 minute video.   This screen can be viewed from inside or outside. The project emphasizes environmental awareness and reflection, blending artistic vision with technical immersion.

This proposal details the testing and development of projection fabrics, structural systems, and audio configurations to realize the artistic vision. Conducted at City Tech, CUNY Brooklyn, initial evaluations will test the  integration of artistic and technical elements ahead of the installationâ€™s premiere at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Montclair NJ. in late spring/early summer 2025.

This repository stores materials and research for the development and installation of this exhibition.
