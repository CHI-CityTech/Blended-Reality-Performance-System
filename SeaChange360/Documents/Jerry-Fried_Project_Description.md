### Overview
This document is a brief summary of our plans to present _*SeaChange*_ at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation at 67 Church Street Montclair, NJ this coming spring. The co-ministers, Revs. Anya and Scott Sammler-Michael would like to have this installed and viewable on several evenings over a period of one or two weeks (specific dates TBD) after Scott returns from a sabbatical on March 10, 2025. The plan is for a Thursday or Friday night opening of the work.

### Project Description
SeaChange is an immersive 360 video which, featuring local NYC surfers, dives into the ocean and human connection. Highlighting human endeavors and aspirations, it traverses the evolutionary origin of life on our planet.  The viewer becomes a participant as SeaChange surrounds them, occupying their entire visual and audio field. SeaChange runs for approximately 20 minutes and will be a part of an evening event running about 90 minutes.  It is the creation of painter/multimedia artists Debrah Pearson Feinn and Jerry Fried.  The support team of craftspeople and surfers all advocate for a restored and healthy ocean. It can be previewed here, where a viewer can use their mouse to access different perspectives.

It will be projected in Fletcher Hall, UUCM's small theater pictured in this Photosphere. The room is about 45' square and the only outside windows will be entirely covered, creating a space in which the only light will be from the projectors, illuminating a cylindrical screen and suspended from the ceiling about five feet from the floor, allowing viewing from inside or outside of the circle (see drawing). Viewers are free to view the images from any point in the room and may move freely.

The video projectors will be suspended from the ceiling and the speakers will be concealed in each of the room's corners, creating an all-encompassing sensory field during each screening.

The specific installation will include the following elements:
* Overlapping projection consisting of six or more quality projectors with software to provide the "soft edges" to create a seamless 360 image field. mounted just above and outside the screen with HDMI and wiring fed from above to the video sources in the "tech booth".
* Video sources TBD but may be multiple Raspberry Pi or stand-alone source for ~8k video.
* Surround audio via speakers concealed at the rooms edges with concealed wiring to the "tech booth".
* Gray projection screen fabric to increase contrast, permitting both bright whites and deep blacks.
* A pulley system to position the screen for each performance but allow it to be lifted several feet so that the room can be used for other activities.
* Blackout curtains over each of the exterior windows so they can be opened before and after each screening.
