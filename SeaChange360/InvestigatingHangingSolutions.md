# Proposal: Development and Testing for the *SeaChange* Immersive Installation

## Project Description

### Detailed Project Description: *SeaChange* Immersive Installation

*SeaChange* is a 360-degree multimedia installation designed to transport audiences into a fully immersive environment that merges visual storytelling with rich soundscapes. Drawing inspiration from the ocean's beauty, power, and mystery, the project explores the intricate relationship between humanity and the natural world. Featuring local NYC surfers, the piece dives into the ocean and human connection, traversing the evolutionary origin of life on our planet. 

The viewer becomes a participant as *SeaChange* surrounds them, occupying their entire visual and audio field. The immersive experience runs for approximately 20 minutes and will be a part of a 90-minute evening event. It is the creation of painter/multimedia artists [Debrah Pearson Feinn](https://www.instagram.com/debrah_feinn/) and [Jerry Fried](https://www.facebook.com/jerryfriedhome/). supported by a team of craftspeople and surfers who advocate for a restored and healthy ocean. A preview of the installation, including 360-degree perspectives, can be accessed online.

The installation will be presented in [Fletcher Hall](https://www.uumontclair.org/rentals/) at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Montclair (UUCM), located at **67 Church Street, Montclair, NJ** in Spring 2025. Testing and prototyping for the installation are being conducted at **City Tech, CUNY Brooklyn**, studio LG-038, utilizing its advanced facilities and sound stage. These spaces provide the ideal environment to evaluate and refine the visual, auditory, and structural components of the project before the final installation.

### **Audience Experience**
Upon entering the installation, participants encounter a circular projection screen suspended from the ceiling, with its bottom edge approximately 5 feet above the ground. This design allows audience members to duck under the screen, granting them the freedom to explore the exhibition from either within or outside the enclosure. The projections wrap seamlessly around the screen, creating a continuous and unbroken visual field.

- **Visual Immersion**: Projections depict vivid oceanic imagery and scenes of surfers practicing their craft, transitioning fluidly between a variety of different scenes, abstract artistic visuals, and dynamic depictions of humanity's interaction with the sea.
- **Soundscapes**: A surround sound audio system immerses the room, enveloping the audience in the synchronized sound and music track, including ambient ocean sounds, music, and narrative elements (specific audio details to be determined). The audio dynamically complements the visuals, enhancing the storytelling.
- **Interactive Freedom**: The open-space layout allows participants to choose their perspective. Viewers can walk around the installation or remain stationary, experiencing the projections and soundscapes from their unique vantage points.

### **Technical Goals**
To achieve this immersive experience, the system must:
1. **Deliver Seamless Visuals**: The circular projection screen must eliminate visible seams and distortions to maintain an unbroken visual field.
2. **Optimize Soundscapes**: Surround sound must dynamically align with the visuals to deepen audience immersion, and provide an effective experience throughout the exhibition space.
3. **Encourage Interaction**: The installation design must allow participants to explore the space freely, both within and outside the projection screen.
4. **Accommodate Flexibility**: The system must be modular, enabling installation in various venues while maintaining the integrity of the immersive design.
5. **Safety and Accessibility**: The design must comply with fire code requirements, including minimal but effective lighting for navigation.

### **Blackout Environment**
The installation operates in near-total darkness, amplifying the impact of the projections and soundscapes as the primary sensory elements. To ensure participant safety and meet fire code requirements, minimal lighting—such as dim glow strips around the perimeter—will be installed. These subtle lights provide navigational guidance without detracting from the immersive atmosphere. The blackout environment enhances contrast and vibrancy, making the visuals appear lifelike and striking.

### **Connection to the Audience**
Through its captivating visuals and soundscapes, *SeaChange* offers an intimate and thought-provoking experience that immerses participants in the ocean’s beauty and interconnectedness. By providing the freedom to engage with the installation from multiple perspectives, the piece invites audiences to reflect on humanity’s relationship with the natural world, fostering awe, curiosity, and a sense of environmental stewardship.

### Bottom Connection Testing

The bottom connection of the projection fabric plays a crucial role in ensuring the screen remains smooth and distortion-free while accommodating audience interaction. For the *SeaChange* installation, simplicity and flexibility are key design goals. A preferred solution would eliminate the need for rigid support at the bottom, as such structures could impede audience movement, particularly when participants duck under the screen to experience the installation from inside the enclosure. 

While a rigid bottom frame can provide uniform tension, it presents challenges in terms of practicality and audience accessibility. Instead, we aim to explore less intrusive methods that maintain fabric tautness while minimizing surface distortion. Weighted edges or free-hanging configurations may offer effective alternatives, balancing simplicity with functionality. 

The testing will focus on how various bottom connection methods influence:
- **Fabric Distortion**: Evaluating which approach minimizes wrinkles and maintains a smooth projection surface.
- **Audience Accessibility**: Ensuring the setup allows participants to move freely under and around the screen without obstruction.
- **Ease of Installation**: Prioritizing solutions that are lightweight, adaptable, and simple to set up in diverse venues.

By emphasizing flexibility and practicality, the goal is to identify a bottom connection method that complements the immersive nature of *SeaChange* without introducing visual or physical barriers for the audience.
