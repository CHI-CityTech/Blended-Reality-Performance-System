## 1. Project Description

### 1.1 Overview

*SeaChange 360* is an immersive multimedia installation designed to transport audiences into a fully immersive environment that merges visual storytelling with rich soundscapes. Drawing inspiration from the ocean's beauty, power, and mystery, the project explores the intricate relationship between humanity and the natural world. Featuring local NYC surfers, the piece dives into the ocean and human connection, traversing the evolutionary origin of life on our planet. 

The viewer becomes a participant as *SeaChange* surrounds them, occupying their entire visual and audio field. The immersive experience runs for approximately 20 minutes and will be a part of a 90-minute evening event. It is the creation of painter/multimedia artists [**Debrah Pearson Feinn**](https://www.instagram.com/debrah_feinn/) and [**Jerry Fried**](https://www.facebook.com/jerryfriedhome/), supported by a team of craftspeople and surfers who advocate for a restored and healthy ocean. A preview of the installation, including 360-degree perspectives, can be accessed online.

The installation will be presented in [Fletcher Hall](https://www.uumontclair.org/rentals/) at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Montclair (UUCM), located at **67 Church Street, Montclair, NJ**, in Spring 2025. Testing and prototyping for the installation are being conducted at **City Tech, CUNY Brooklyn**, Studio LG-038, utilizing its advanced facilities and sound stage. These spaces provide the ideal environment to evaluate and refine the visual, auditory, and structural components of the project before the final installation.

The testing and prototyping initiative is led by [**Dr. David B. Smith**](https://sites.google.com/view/drdavidbsmith/home) and his students, focusing on evaluating projection fabrics, structural systems, and immersive audio setups to ensure the installation achieves its technical and artistic goals. Rigorous experimentation and refinement aim to finalize a seamless and adaptable design for the immersive environment.

### 1.2 Audience Experience

## 6. Structural Systems

### 6.1 Narrative: Structural System Needs and Requirements

The structural system for the *SeaChange* installation serves as the armature for achieving the immersive and seamless experience envisioned for the project. It must securely support the projection fabric, provide appropriate tensioning to maintain a smooth surface, ensure that projected images are not distorted, and enable modularity to adapt to different venues. Given the installation's unique design, the framework must also accommodate the specific needs of a cylindrical or similarly immersive configuration. However, a more generalized solution would allow for alternate shapes based on specific needs and aesthetics.

### 6.2 Structural Needs

#### 6.2.1 Basic Structural Needs

1. **Tensioning Capability**:
   - The system must ensure the projection fabric remains taut to minimize wrinkles, sagging, or distortions that could compromise image quality.
   - The system should mitigate unwanted movement, such as billowing, caused by airflow or other external factors. Since people will be ducking under the projection fabric, some billowing is unavoidable, but the solution should minimize this. 

2. **Shape and Configuration**:
   - While a circular configuration is the baseline assumption, alternative shapes (e.g., ovoid, wave-like, or evocative of ocean forms) could offer artistic opportunities. 
   - The flexibility to explore and adjust the structure’s shape may enhance its expressive potential while maintaining visual and functional integrity.
   - Distortions caused by irregular shapes must be evaluated in conjunction with projected imagery to ensure immersive continuity.

3. **Modularity and Portability**:
   - The system should be lightweight for ease of transportation and installation, while maintaining structural stability.
   - Modular components are preferred to enable flexible configurations and adaptability across different venues.

4. **Audience Accessibility**:
   - The design must allow participants to freely enter and exit the interior of the installation by ducking under the suspended fabric.
   - Structural elements should not obstruct audience movement or interfere with the immersive experience.

5. **Durability and Safety**:
   - The framework must comply with safety standards, including stable anchoring points and fire-code-compliant materials.
   - It must reliably support the projection fabric and associated equipment (e.g., projectors, speakers) over the course of multiple showings.

#### 6.2.2 Connective Structural Needs: Integration with the Fabric

1. **Fabric Attachment**:
   - The method of attaching the projection fabric to the structure must be straightforward, secure, and allow for uniform tensioning.
   - Some existing systems may already have provisions for attachements, while others may expect the user to determine how this is done.
   - Systems such as keder rails, clamps, or pre-sewn loops may be evaluated for effectiveness and ease of use.

2. **Tensioning Mechanism**:
   - The system must include a means of fine-tuning the fabric’s tension to prevent wrinkles and ensure a smooth surface.
   - Options include adjustable fasteners, tension cables, or integrated tensioning mechanisms.
   - Gravity will be a friend, but 

3. **Ceiling Connection**:
   - The structure must provide secure attachment points to the ceiling or other overhead supports. 
   - Adjustable hanging solutions (e.g., chains, turnbuckles, or pulley systems) should allow for height and angle adjustments to align the projection surface precisely.

4. **Flexibility in Configuration**:
   - Flexibility in how the fabric is integrated with the structure is essential to accommodate experimental designs, including irregular shapes or surfaces evocative of ocean waves.
   - Testing will determine whether these configurations enhance or detract from the immersive quality of the projections.

#### 6.2.2 Portability and Load Considerations

- The structural system must strike a balance between portability and load-bearing capacity. A lighter system is preferable, provided it meets tensioning, stability, and safety requirements.
- Modular and collapsible components should be prioritized to facilitate transport and storage.

### 6.3 Research Questions

1. How do alternative shapes (e.g., ovoid or wave-like) affect projected imagery?
2. What tensioning methods minimize fabric distortion and billowing?
3. How well do different attachment methods (e.g., clamps, keder rails) integrate with the chosen fabrics?
4. Can the structural system allow for experimental designs while maintaining immersive quality?
5. How effectively can the system secure to the ceiling while permitting flexibility in height and angle adjustments?

## 7. Audio Testing

### 7.1 Narrative: Audio Testing Goals

The audio component of *SeaChange* is essential for creating an immersive environment that complements the visuals and reinforces the audience’s connection to the thematic content. A central focus of the audio testing phase is to evaluate how sound delivery functions for audiences both inside and outside the circular projection screen, addressing the unique spatial challenges of this dual-perspective experience.

Under the current concept, speakers are envisioned to be placed around the perimeter of the exhibition space. This configuration naturally results in a reversed relationship between sound localization and the direction of the projection depending on the audience’s position. For those inside the circle, the sound will appear to emanate from behind the projection imagery, aligning with conventional expectations for immersive media. For those outside the circle, the sound will instead come from behind the audience, creating a different spatial relationship. Testing will assess whether this configuration supports the intended immersive experience or requires adjustments.

This initial layout offers the potential advantage of simplifying speaker placement and providing broad spatial coverage. However, it also introduces questions about clarity, localization, and whether the reversed audio perspective disrupts the audience’s engagement with the narrative. Testing will explore whether this configuration effectively delivers the creators’ artistic intent and how adjustments to speaker placement, orientation, or mixing might improve the experience.

Currently, the audio mix is in stereo, but the testing phase will evaluate opportunities for larger surround sound formats, such as 5.1, 7.1, or Dolby Atmos. Separating audio stems—such as dialogue, music, and ambient sounds—will allow for greater flexibility in distributing the audio across multiple channels, creating a more spatially dynamic experience. These explorations will be critical to determining whether the sound design enhances immersion without drawing attention to its technical elements.

The iterative testing process will also examine how the chosen speaker configuration interacts with the acoustics of the testing and final installation venues, audience movement, and the projection environment. These findings will guide refinements to the audio system, ensuring it aligns with the thematic and sensory goals of *SeaChange*.
