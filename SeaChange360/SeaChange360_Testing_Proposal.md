# Proposal: Development and Testing for the *SeaChange* Immersive Installation

---

## 1. Project Description

*SeaChange* is a 360-degree multimedia installation designed to transport audiences into a fully immersive environment that merges visual storytelling with rich soundscapes. Drawing inspiration from the ocean's beauty, power, and mystery, the project explores the intricate relationship between humanity and the natural world. Featuring local NYC surfers, the piece dives into the ocean and human connection, traversing the evolutionary origin of life on our planet. 

The viewer becomes a participant as *SeaChange* surrounds them, occupying their entire visual and audio field. The immersive experience runs for approximately 20 minutes and will be a part of a 90-minute evening event. It is the creation of painter/multimedia artists [**Debrah Pearson Feinn**](https://www.instagram.com/debrah_feinn/) and [**Jerry Fried**](https://www.facebook.com/jerryfriedhome/), supported by a team of craftspeople and surfers who advocate for a restored and healthy ocean. A preview of the installation, including 360-degree perspectives, can be accessed online.

The installation will be presented in [Fletcher Hall](https://www.uumontclair.org/rentals/) at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Montclair (UUCM), located at **67 Church Street, Montclair, NJ**, in Spring 2025. Testing and prototyping for the installation are being conducted at **City Tech, CUNY Brooklyn**, Studio LG-038, utilizing its advanced facilities and sound stage. These spaces provide the ideal environment to evaluate and refine the visual, auditory, and structural components of the project before the final installation.

The testing and prototyping initiative is led by [**Dr. David B. Smith**](https://sites.google.com/view/drdavidbsmith/home) and his students, focusing on evaluating projection fabrics, structural systems, and immersive audio setups to ensure the installation achieves its technical and artistic goals. Rigorous experimentation and refinement aim to finalize a seamless and adaptable design for the immersive environment.

### 1.1 Audience Experience

Upon entering the installation, participants encounter a circular projection screen suspended from the ceiling, with its bottom edge approximately 5 feet above the ground. This design allows audience members to duck under the screen, granting them the freedom to explore the exhibition from either within or outside the enclosure. The projections wrap seamlessly around the screen, creating a continuous and unbroken visual field.

- **Visual Immersion**: Projections depict vivid oceanic imagery and scenes of surfers practicing their craft, transitioning fluidly between various visuals, abstract artistic elements, and dynamic depictions of humanity's interaction with the sea.
- **Soundscapes**: A surround sound audio system immerses the room, enveloping the audience with synchronized ambient ocean sounds, music, and narrative elements (specific details TBA). 
- **Interactive Freedom**: The open-space layout allows participants to choose their perspective. Viewers can walk around the installation or remain stationary, experiencing the projections and soundscapes from their unique vantage points.

### 1.2 Technical Goals

To achieve this immersive experience, the system must:
1. Deliver seamless visuals with no visible distortions or interruptions.
2. Optimize surround sound to dynamically complement the visuals.
3. Enable audience interaction and free movement within and outside the screen.
4. Ensure modularity for flexible installations in various venues.
5. Comply with safety regulations, including minimal but effective lighting for navigation.

### 1.3 Blackout Environment

The installation operates in near-total darkness, enhancing the impact of the projections and soundscapes. Minimal lighting—such as dim glow strips around the room’s perimeter—ensures navigational safety while preserving immersion. This setting heightens contrast and vibrancy, making the projections appear lifelike and striking.

### 1.4 Connection to the Audience

By blending captivating visuals and soundscapes, *SeaChange* invites participants to reflect on humanity’s relationship with the natural world. Offering freedom of movement and multiple perspectives, it fosters curiosity, awe, and environmental stewardship.

## 4. Fabric Testing Process

The testing phase for the *SeaChange* installation focuses on identifying the most effective combination of projection fabrics, structural systems, and audio-visual components. These tests are essential to ensure seamless visuals, reliable tensioning methods, and immersive soundscapes that align with the project’s goals. All experiments will replicate the final installation environment, including a circular configuration with blackout conditions, to evaluate real-world performance.

Key testing requirements include:
- **Projection Quality**: Evaluate fabrics for brightness, contrast, and clarity under front and rear projection.
- **Tensioning Methods**: Test track systems, pipe frameworks, and truss designs for their ability to maintain fabric tautness with minimal distortion.
- **Audience Interaction**: Ensure systems allow for unrestricted movement within and outside the screen without compromising the projection surface.
- **Soundscapes**: Align the surround sound system with visual elements, ensuring spatial and auditory immersion.
- **Adaptability**: Confirm that the selected systems are modular, portable, and capable of being installed in diverse venues, including Montclair UU Church.

Through intial testing at City Tech, the project aims to finalize a design that delivers an effective and engaging immersive experience.

### 4.1 Testing Goals
