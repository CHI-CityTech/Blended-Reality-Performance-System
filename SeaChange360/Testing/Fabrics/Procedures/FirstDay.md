# Goal for the First Day of Testing

The primary goal for the first day of testing (2025-01-16) is to assemble and configure the testing infrastructure to ensure all equipment and materials are prepared for subsequent evaluation. This includes setting up the T-slot 6' x 6' frame, acquiring appropriate test images, calibrating the projector, and positioning cameras to capture simultaneous front and rear projection images. By the end of the day, the team aims to establish a stable testing environment and document the setup process for consistent replication in future sessions.

## Specific Objectives

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- Assemble the T-slot 6' x 6' frame for mounting fabric samples.
- Secure the frame and verify its stability to prevent movement during testing.
- Prepare a blackout environment to minimize ambient light interference.
- Aquire appropriate test images. see document here for specifics. 

### 2. Equipment Configuration
- Set up the projector and calibrate brightness, contrast, and focus.
- Position two cameras:
  - One to capture the projected image on the front side of the fabric.
  - One to capture the rear projection image through the fabric.

### 3. Documentation Preparation
- Test photographic and video capture workflows to ensure both cameras provide clear, comparable results.
- Verify alignment of the projector and cameras to ensure identical framing for front and rear images.

### 4. Initial Evaluation
- Conduct a dry run using a single fabric sample to validate the setup and identify any adjustments needed for subsequent tests.

### 5. Documentation
- Record the entire setup process, including diagrams, photographs, and observational notes, to ensure consistency in future testing.

## Outcome
By completing these objectives, the team will ensure a reliable and repeatable testing framework, laying the groundwork for evaluating all selected fabrics in the following sessions.
