# Fabric Testing Part One: Setup

This and following documents specify in greater detail the testing process for identifying an appropriate fabric for the _SeaChange 360_ project as described in the initial proposal [here](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Reality-Performance-System/blob/main/SeaChange360/Documents/SeaChange360_Testing_Proposal.md#4-fabric-testing).  The primary goal for the first day of testing (2025-01-16) is to assemble and configure the testing infrastructure to ensure all equipment and materials are prepared for subsequent evaluation. This includes setting up the T-slot 6' x 6' frame, acquiring appropriate test images, calibrating the projector, and positioning cameras to capture simultaneous front and rear projection images. As well, generating the documents to record and store the information will need to be completed. By the end of the day, the team aims to establish a stable testing environment and document the setup process for consistent replication in future sessions.

## Specific Objectives

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- Assemble the T-slot 6' x 6' frame for mounting fabric samples.
- Secure the frame and verify its stability to prevent movement during testing.
- Prepare a blackout environment to minimize ambient light interference.
- Aquire appropriate test images. see document [Test_Images.md](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Blended-Reality-Performance-System/blob/main/SeaChange360/Testing/Fabrics/Procedures/Test_Images.md) for specifics. 

### 2. Equipment Configuration
- Set up the projector and calibrate brightness, contrast, and focus.
- Position two cameras:
  - One to capture the projected image on the front side of the fabric.
  - One to capture the rear projection image through the fabric.

### 3. Documentation Preparation
- Test photographic and video capture workflows to ensure both cameras provide clear, comparable results.
- Verify alignment of the projector and cameras to ensure identical framing for front and rear images.

### 4. Initial Evaluation
- Conduct a dry run using a single fabric sample to validate the setup and identify any adjustments needed for subsequent tests.

### 5. Documentation
- Record the entire setup process, including diagrams, photographs, and observational notes, to ensure consistency in future testing.

## Outcome
By completing these objectives, the team will ensure a reliable and repeatable testing framework, laying the groundwork for evaluating all selected fabrics in the following sessions.

## Materials and Equipment

### Framework and Fabric
- **T-slot 80/20 frame** (6' x 6')
- **Testing fabrics** (list fabrics to be tested, such as Glowup, SoftScreen, etc.)
- **Clamps** for securing fabrics to the frame
- **Weight bars** or other tensioning tools to minimize sagging

### Projection Equipment
- **Projector** (e.g., [Brand/Model Name])
  - Native resolution: [e.g., 4K or 1080p]
  - Lumens: [e.g., 3000 lumens]
  - Contrast ratio: [e.g., 1000:1]
- **HDMI cables** for data transmission (2)
- **Power cables** for projector
- **Laptop** or media player to source the projection material
- **Projection content**: Test patterns (brightness, contrast, color) and sample images

### Camera Equipment
Note: Cameras used may be iPad or iPhone devices.  We will do some testing of this.
- **Cameras** (2)
  - Resolution: [e.g., 1080p or 4K]
  - Capable of simultaneous recording
  - Adjustable tripods
- **Camera power adapters** or fully charged batteries
- **SD cards** or other storage devices for image capture
- **USB cables** for data transfer (optional)

### Additional Equipment
- **Power strips** with surge protection
- **Extension cords** (if necessary)
- **Adjustable worktable** for laptop and peripherals
- **Rolling cart** for transporting equipment
- **Step ladder** (if needed for setup adjustments)
- **Blackout curtains** to create a controlled lighting environment
- **Measurement tools** (e.g., tape measure, laser level)

## Setup Procedure

### Step 1: Frame Assembly
1. Assemble the **T-slot 80/20 frame** into a 6' x 6' structure using provided connectors and tools.
2. Attach fabric clamps to the top beam of the frame.
3. Prepare the testing fabrics by cutting them to the required size (if necessary) and securing them to the frame.
4. Add weight bars or tensioning tools at the bottom edge of the fabric to ensure a smooth, wrinkle-free surface.

### Step 2: Projector Setup
1. Position the projector approximately 8–10 feet from the frame, ensuring the projection covers the full fabric surface.
2. Connect the projector to the **laptop/media player** using an **HDMI cable**.
3. Plug in the projector’s power cable and connect it to a surge-protected power strip.
4. Turn on the projector and verify that the test content is being displayed.
5. Adjust the projector’s position and focus to achieve a sharp image.

### Step 3: Camera Setup
1. Set up **two cameras**:
   - **Camera 1**: Positioned to capture the front projection.
   - **Camera 2**: Positioned to capture the rear projection.
2. Mount both cameras on adjustable tripods for precise alignment.
3. Verify that the cameras are centered and perpendicular to the projection fabric.
4. Insert **SD cards** into both cameras and ensure sufficient storage space.
5. Connect cameras to power or ensure batteries are fully charged.

### Step 4: Cable Management
1. Use **cable ties** or clips to organize HDMI, power, and data cables, minimizing trip hazards.
2. Ensure all cables are securely connected and have sufficient slack to avoid tension.
3. Test all connections by powering on the projector, cameras, and laptop.

### Step 5: Lighting and Environment
1. Install **blackout curtains** or other light-blocking materials to create a controlled testing environment.
2. Use measurement tools to verify that the frame is level and aligned with the projector.
3. Adjust the room’s ambient lighting to minimize interference with the projection.

### Step 6: Preliminary Test
1. Project a test pattern onto the fabric and capture images/videos with both cameras.
2. Verify that the test content is visible on both the front and rear of the fabric.
3. Check the initial image quality, including brightness, contrast, and clarity.
4. Troubleshoot any alignment, focus, or connectivity issues.

## Deliverables for Day 1
- Fully assembled and aligned testing setup.
- Verified functionality of projector, cameras, and other equipment.
- Documentation of the initial setup process, including:
  - Schematic of test setup, including signal flow and plan.
  - Photos of the frame and fabric installation
  - Photos of projector and camera positioning
  - Notes on any adjustments or challenges encountered during setup.

**Next Steps**:
- Begin fabric projection testing as outlined in the Testing Plan.
- Prepare for subsequent tests using circular tracks and additional configurations.
