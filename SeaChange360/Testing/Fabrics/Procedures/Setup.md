# Initial Setup for Fabric Projection Testing

This document outlines the steps and materials required to set up the initial environment for testing projection on various fabrics. The setup focuses on ensuring proper infrastructure and connections for evaluating front and rear projections.

---

## Goals of Initial Setup
- Assemble the T-slot 80/20 frame to suspend testing fabrics.
- Configure the projector and cameras for simultaneous front and rear image capture.
- Prepare all power, data, and HDMI cables required for seamless operation.
- Verify functionality of equipment and workspace readiness.

## Materials and Equipment

### Framework and Fabric
- **T-slot 80/20 frame** (6' x 6')
- **Testing fabrics** (list fabrics to be tested, such as Glowup, SoftScreen, etc.)
- **Clamps** for securing fabrics to the frame
- **Weight bars** or other tensioning tools to minimize sagging

### Projection Equipment
- **Projector** (e.g., [Brand/Model Name])
  - Native resolution: [e.g., 4K or 1080p]
  - Lumens: [e.g., 3000 lumens]
  - Contrast ratio: [e.g., 1000:1]
- **HDMI cables** for data transmission (2)
- **Power cables** for projector
- **Laptop** or media player to source the projection material
- **Projection content**: Test patterns (brightness, contrast, color) and sample images

### Camera Equipment
- **Cameras** (2)
  - Resolution: [e.g., 1080p or 4K]
  - Capable of simultaneous recording
  - Adjustable tripods
- **Camera power adapters** or fully charged batteries
- **SD cards** or other storage devices for image capture
- **USB cables** for data transfer (optional)

### Additional Equipment
- **Power strips** with surge protection
- **Extension cords** (if necessary)
- **Adjustable worktable** for laptop and peripherals
- **Rolling cart** for transporting equipment
- **Step ladder** (if needed for setup adjustments)
- **Blackout curtains** to create a controlled lighting environment
- **Measurement tools** (e.g., tape measure, laser level)

## Setup Procedure

### Step 1: Frame Assembly
1. Assemble the **T-slot 80/20 frame** into a 6' x 6' structure using provided connectors and tools.
2. Attach fabric clamps to the top beam of the frame.
3. Prepare the testing fabrics by cutting them to the required size (if necessary) and securing them to the frame.
4. Add weight bars or tensioning tools at the bottom edge of the fabric to ensure a smooth, wrinkle-free surface.

### Step 2: Projector Setup
1. Position the projector approximately 8–10 feet from the frame, ensuring the projection covers the full fabric surface.
2. Connect the projector to the **laptop/media player** using an **HDMI cable**.
3. Plug in the projector’s power cable and connect it to a surge-protected power strip.
4. Turn on the projector and verify that the test content is being displayed.
5. Adjust the projector’s position and focus to achieve a sharp image.

### Step 3: Camera Setup
1. Set up **two cameras**:
   - **Camera 1**: Positioned to capture the front projection.
   - **Camera 2**: Positioned to capture the rear projection.
2. Mount both cameras on adjustable tripods for precise alignment.
3. Verify that the cameras are centered and perpendicular to the projection fabric.
4. Insert **SD cards** into both cameras and ensure sufficient storage space.
5. Connect cameras to power or ensure batteries are fully charged.

### Step 4: Cable Management
1. Use **cable ties** or clips to organize HDMI, power, and data cables, minimizing trip hazards.
2. Ensure all cables are securely connected and have sufficient slack to avoid tension.
3. Test all connections by powering on the projector, cameras, and laptop.

### Step 5: Lighting and Environment
1. Install **blackout curtains** or other light-blocking materials to create a controlled testing environment.
2. Use measurement tools to verify that the frame is level and aligned with the projector.
3. Adjust the room’s ambient lighting to minimize interference with the projection.

### Step 6: Preliminary Test
1. Project a test pattern onto the fabric and capture images/videos with both cameras.
2. Verify that the test content is visible on both the front and rear of the fabric.
3. Check the initial image quality, including brightness, contrast, and clarity.
4. Troubleshoot any alignment, focus, or connectivity issues.
