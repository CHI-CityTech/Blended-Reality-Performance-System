# Test Image Selection

## Importance of Test Image Selection

The selection of test images is a critical aspect of evaluating projection performance during the *SeaChange 360* fabric testing process.  Images must be carefully chosen to test various aspectis ofthe capabilities and limitations of different fabrics when subjected to both front and rear projection. The test images serve several key purposes:

1. **Calibration and Standardization**: Standard test patterns, such as color bars and grayscale gradients, establish a baseline for evaluating color accuracy, brightness, and contrast. These patterns ensure that projectors are properly calibrated and allow for consistent comparisons across different fabrics.

2. **Real-World Representation**: High-resolution photographs, such as portraits and landscapes, simulate the types of visuals likely to be used in the *SeaChange* installation. Testing these images helps evaluate how fabrics handle realistic content, including fine details, gradients, and complex color palettes.

3. **Text and Edge Clarity**: Text charts and line drawings assess the sharpness and readability of fine details. These elements are crucial for determining whether the projection fabric can maintain crisp edges and clear distinctions between adjacent colors.

4. **Stress Testing Fabric Performance**: Each test image highlights specific aspects of projection performance, such as the ability to handle high-contrast scenes, subtle gradients, and dynamic lighting. This helps identify any weaknesses or artifacts introduced by the fabric's surface or texture.

5. **Versatility for Future Projects**: The results of these tests will not only inform fabric selection for *SeaChange* but also provide valuable data for other projects, such as the Blended Shadow Puppet initiative. Ensuring a broad yet focused range of test images ensures the findings remain versatile and applicable beyond this specific project.

By employing a carefully curated selection of test images, we can systematically evaluate fabric performance and ensure the final materials meet the artistic and technical requirements of the *SeaChange 360* installation.


## Refined Test Image List


### 1. Standard Test Patterns (Essential for Calibration)
- **Color Bars**: To evaluate color accuracy.
- **Gray Scale with Gradients**: To test contrast and gradient rendering.
- **Grid Pattern**: To check for distortion and alignment.
- **Checkerboard**: To evaluate contrast and edge sharpness.

### 2. High-Resolution Photographs (Representative Visuals)
- **Portrait with Natural Skin Tones**: For testing color accuracy and fine detail.
- **Ocean Landscape**: Representative of *SeaChange* themes, with gradients and fine details.
- **Nighttime Cityscape**: To assess performance in dark scenes with bright highlights.

### 3. Text and Fine Details
- **Text Chart**: A single chart with multiple font sizes and weights.
- **Line Drawing**: A simple high-contrast black-and-white pattern to test edge sharpness.
