# Fabric Testing for SeaChange 360 Installation

This repository contains all materials, data, and analysis related to the testing of projection fabrics for the *SeaChange 360* immersive installation. The focus is on evaluating the performance of various fabrics under front and rear projection to ensure seamless, high-quality visuals that support the project's artistic and technical goals.  

Date of testing starts January 16, 2025.

## Project Overview

The *SeaChange 360* installation is a multimedia experience that combines immersive visuals and soundscapes to explore humanityâ€™s connection to the ocean. A key component of the installation is the use of projection fabrics capable of delivering equivalent image quality on both front and rear sides. This testing phase will determine the optimal fabric choices for the installation while also providing insights for other creative projects, such as the *Blended Shadow Puppet* initiative.

## Testing Objectives

1. Evaluate the performance of selected fabrics for front and rear projection.
2. Assess fabric properties, including:
   - Brightness
   - Clarity
   - Color fidelity
   - Light diffusion
   - Transparency
3. Capture simultaneous photographic and video documentation of both sides of each fabric during projection tests using a single projector and two cameras.
4. Generate data to inform material selection for *SeaChange 360* and other projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### `/Setup`
- Documentation on testing infrastructure and equipment configuration.
- Includes diagrams and instructions for assembling the T-slot frame and positioning cameras for front and rear image capture.

### `/Fabrics`
- List of fabrics under evaluation, with detailed descriptions and links to suppliers.
- Fabric inventory status and properties.

### `/Test_Procedures`
- Step-by-step procedures for fabric testing, including:
  - Single-projector calibration
  - Simultaneous front and rear capture using two cameras
  - Data collection protocols

### `/Images`
- High-resolution photos and videos of projection tests.
- Organized by fabric name and projection side (e.g., `FabricName_Front`, `FabricName_Rear`).

### `/Raw_Data`
- Quantitative measurements such as light meter readings.
- Observational notes from testing sessions.
- Includes `Fabric_Test_Results_Template.md` for standardizing data recording.

### `/Results`
- Summarized findings and analysis for each fabric.
- Recommendations for the *SeaChange* installation and other potential use cases.

### `/Reports`
- Comprehensive testing reports for internal review and future reference.

## Key Personnel

- **Dr. David B. Smith**: Project Lead
- **Lab Assistants**: Support for setup, testing, and data documentation.

## Testing Process

1. Assemble the T-slot 6' x 6' frame and mount fabric samples.
2. Set up a single projector to display test images onto the fabric.
3. Position two cameras:
   - One to capture the front projection image.
   - One to capture the rear projection image.
4. Calibrate the projector for optimal brightness, contrast, and alignment.
5. Capture photographic and video data simultaneously from both sides of the fabric.
6. Record quantitative measurements (e.g., brightness) and qualitative observations (e.g., visual artifacts).
7. Conduct side-by-side comparisons of multiple fabrics under identical conditions.
8. Document findings in the repository for analysis and decision-making.
